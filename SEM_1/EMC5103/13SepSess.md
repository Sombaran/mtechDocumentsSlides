## Random variable

- Previously we discussed about random experiment, where we were concerned about the outcomes and number assocaited with it
- R.V is simply a function from sample space to real number
- R.V is a function with domain S and range {-$\infty$, +$\infty$} such that for every real number _a_ the event

## Results of RV

- A function X(w) from S to RV {-$\infty$, +$\infty$} is a RV,iff for for real a = {w : X(w) < a }
- If X1 and X2 is RV then-
  - max {X1, X2} is also RV
  - min {X1, X2} is also RV
- If X is a RV then f(.) __f of that function__ is a continous/ increasing function then f(X) is also RV

## Types of random variable

- Discrete RV
  - A variable which can real value on a discrete sample space is called DRV
  - For eg. marks obtained in exam, number of accidents per month
  - Probability mass function and Probability density function

  - PMF
    - If you a DRV if you probablitistic behaviour at each point then it is called PMF

- Continous RV

## Distribution function

- If X is RV then function defined of all real number _x_  by
  - f(X) = P(X <= x) = P {w: X(w) <= x}, -$\infty$ < x < +$\infty$

## Remark of distributtion function
