- What is probabilty
  - If an experiment is repeated under similar conditions then there are two types of situations. Deteministic and probabilistic
  - If the result of an experiment is unique or certain then it is called as deterministic. For eg. Speed =  distance/ time
  - If the result of an experiment is not unique but one of the several possible outcomes then it is called as probalistic. For eg. Tossing of a coin/ Card/ Dice
  - Keywords which points to degree of uncertainity __possibly__, __high chance__, __likely__, __odd__
  - _It is the measure of uncertainity about happening of an event in number scale of (0 & 1)_
  - Event 0 is _impossible event_
  - Event 1 is _certain event_
  - Event 0 and 1 is _uncertain event_
  - Therefore the numerical measurement of this uncertain event is provided by an important branch of mathematics called as _Theory of probablity_
- Basic terminlogy
  - Random experiment: If an experiment is conducted under identical conditions and expected output is not unique but may be any one of the possible outcomes then such an experiment is called as _random experiment_
  - Outcome: It is the result of a random experiment
  - Trail and Event: Any particular performance case in a random experiment is termed as _trail_ and an outcome or combination of outcome is called as an _event_
  - Exhaustive event: It is the total number of possible outcomes of a random experiment is known as _exhaustive event_ or _case_
  - Favourable event:
