- What is probabilty
  - If an experiment is repeated under similar conditions then there are two types of situations. Deteministic and probabilistic
  - If the result of an experiment is unique or certain then it is called as deterministic. For eg. Speed =  distance/ time
  - If the result of an experiment is not unique but one of the several possible outcomes then it is called as probalistic. For eg. Tossing of a coin/ Card/ Dice
  - Keywords which points to degree of uncertainity __possibly__, __high chance__, __likely__, __odd__
  - _It is the measure of uncertainity about happening of an event in number scale of (0 & 1)_
  - Event 0 is _impossible event_
  - Event 1 is _certain event_
  - Event 0 and 1 is _uncertain event_
  - Therefore the numerical measurement of this uncertain event is provided by an important branch of mathematics called as _Theory of probablity_
- Basic terminlogy
  - __Random experiment__: If an experiment is conducted under identical conditions and expected output is not unique but may be any one of the possible outcomes then such an experiment is called as _random experiment_
  - __Outcome__: It is the result of a random experiment
  - __Trail and Event__: Any particular performance case in a random experiment is termed as _trail_ and an outcome or combination of outcome is called as an _event_
  - __Exhaustive event__: It is the total number of possible outcomes of a random experiment is known as _exhaustive event_ or _case_
  - __Favourable event__: The number of cases favourable to an event in a trail is the number of outcomes which entail the happening of an event
  - __Mutually exclusive event__: In a trail if no two or more events do not happen simultaneosult is called as _mutually exclusive event_ or _at a time one outcome will occur_
  - __Equally likely event__: Every possible outcomes has _equal chance to occur_
  - __Independent events__: For eq. If we throw a dice then at first chance _5_ comes then at second, third,fouth, fifth and sixth chance also _5_ can come

- Probability approaches and types
  - Classical probability
     - Also called as _A Priore_
     - If a random experiment or trail result in _n_ exhaustive, mutually exclusive, equally likely outcomes out of which is _m_ favourable to the occurance of an event _E_, then probability of occurancd of an event _P(E)_ is given by:
    $ \frac{Total number of favourable condition}{Total number of exhaustive events} $
